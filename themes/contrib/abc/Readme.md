*ABC theme for Drupal 8, 9 and 10.*
=================================
Thank you for downloading this theme!


ABOUT THE ABC THEME:
===========================

**ABC** is an advanced responsive, mobile first, HTML5 theme with layout and style configuration options built in that you can control through Drupal's UI. The theme is a highly customized and complex theme that goes beyond the basic customization options provided by Drupal. It uses [Yahoo Pure.css](https://purecss.io), a powerful responsive CSS framework and also fully supports right to left languages. Pure is ridiculously tiny. The entire set of modules clocks in at 3.5KB minified and gzipped.

The theme **validates HTML5 and CSS3**, it is cross-browser compatible, and it complies with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) and [FAE](https://fae.cita.uiuc.edu/).

Module support
----------------------------------------

The theme can support virtualy any module.
This versatile, **base theme** stands alone, free from dependence on other modules or libraries.

  
Theme customisation
----------------------------------------

If you feel like giving the theme a look of your own, I recommend to play with /_custom/custom-style.css; please read the comments in this file.

#### Slideshow
At www.dr.mt, you'll find a compilation of pre-optimized images for your slideshow. Feel free to download them from this source, where the images are organized into sections.


Installation instructions
----------------------------------------

1. Place the abc directory into your themes directory (/themes/abc) or use Composer. If using Composer, the theme will be installed at  /themes/contrib/abc.
2. Enable the ABC theme (/admin/appearance).
3. Proceed to the theme's settings by navigating to /admin/appearance/settings/abc and ensure to save the configuration. Note that some of the theme's settings are multilingual variables, allowing you to configure different settings for each language.
4. Within the themes' directory, locate the "_custom" folder and rename 'example.custom-style.css' to 'custom-style.css'. This file, 'custom-style.css', provides extensive customization options and may contain your custom CSS and CSS overrides. Please read the info of this file.


UPGRADING to a new version of ABC
----------------------------------------

1. Log in as administrator user. 
2. Put the site in "Off-line" mode.
3. Place the abc directory into your themes directory (/themes/abc) or use Composer. In case you have done some theme customization, remember to overwrite theme's custom-style.css with your modified custom-style.css file.
4. Clear cached data at /admin/config/development/performance or "Flush all caches" in Admin Menu and then press CTRL+F5;
5. Put the site in "On-line" mode. It is always a good idea to refresh the browser's cache again.
